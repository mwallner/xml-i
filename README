# xml-i

xml-i is a personal playground project where I experiment with implementing a simple program in various programming languages, focusing on efficiency and performance in each approach.

## Purpose

The core program counts the occurrences of distinct XML nodes in a given XML document. Users can also provide a custom list of node names they are interested in. Additionally, a basic benchmarking feature is included to demonstrate and compare the performance differences between the language implementations.

## Features

- Counts occurrences of all or selected XML node names in a document
- Supports user-specified node name filtering
- Basic benchmarking to compare performance across implementations
- Multiple programming languages, with each version aiming for optimal efficiency

## Motivation

This repository serves as a learning and benchmarking tool, helping to explore language-specific approaches to XML processing and performance optimization.
